  <p>This is a pseudo predictive search I made for a client site. It suggests possible search terms from an array that could theoretically be filled from an outside source, but for my purposes is filled by, well, me.</p>
  <p>I'm slowly working to improve functionality, but it's got the basic stuff there.</p>
